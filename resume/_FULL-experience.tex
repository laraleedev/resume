Implemented and augmented streams of jobs from Bitbucket into multiple Jenkins jobs that built, deployed, reestablished blank state test data, ran integration tests, and deployed to downstream/close to production environments.}
\item {Built Express, Kafka, Flyway, and Postgresdb based microservices based on client created templates. Added and augmented functionality for API endpoints, retrieving/updating data from Postgresdb, and receiving data from Kafka brokers. Implemented authorization placeholder mock service and authorization logic for microservice db lookups. Established and argued for DRY maintainable patterns where possible. Fixed bugs and upped code coverage where possible, especially in templated code.}
\item {Implemented and established a pattern for spinning up and using a local Kubernetes cluster for deploying microservices for development purposes. Built and documented step by step approach from scratch for client dev's needs. Established Istio JWT security token configuration for client usage. Worked with client devs to generate test tokens and example code for client development purposes.}
\item {Implemented pytest docker compose stack for client QE usage. Updated and configured local Kafka instance for test usage. Augmented client scripts to allow publishing test data to test kafka instance, and established pattern for using pytest to publish flexible sets of test data to local Kafka brokers, query postgresdb, and assert expected outcomes. Helped establish variation of pytest docker compose stack for Jenkins pipeline, testing against Kafka instances in already established environments.}
