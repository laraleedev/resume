Implemented UI and functionality following concurrently changing designs with limited specifications, creating DRY reusable patterns for modal templating, api request handling, etc. Implemented POC integration of several components into demo container application.}
\item {Helped establish and push for best practices/standards for Typescript, Tailwind, linting, Jest unit testing, and other project configuration and overhead. Increased test coverage significantly to cover gaps and push toward longterm maintainability and CICD.}
\item {Built Jenkins pipelines and helped establish patterns for CICD according to client's wants. Implemented and augmented streams of jobs from Bitbucket into multiple Jenkins jobs that built, deployed, reestablished blank state test data, ran integration tests, and deployed to downstream/close to production environments.}
\item {Built Express, Kafka, Flyway, and Postgresdb based microservices based on client created templates. Added and augmented functionality for API endpoints, retrieving/updating data from Postgresdb, and receiving data from Kafka brokers. Implemented authorization placeholder mock service and authorization logic for microservice db lookups. Established and argued for DRY maintainable patterns where possible. Fixed bugs and upped code coverage where possible, especially in templated code.}
\item {Implemented and established a pattern for spinning up and using a local Kubernetes cluster for deploying microservices for development purposes. Built and documented step by step approach from scratch for client dev's needs. Established Istio JWT security token configuration for client usage. Worked with client devs to generate test tokens and example code for client development purposes.}
\item {Implemented pytest docker compose stack for client QE usage. Updated and configured local Kafka instance for test usage. Augmented client scripts to allow publishing test data to test kafka instance, and established pattern for using pytest to publish flexible sets of test data to local Kafka brokers, query postgresdb, and assert expected outcomes. Helped establish variation of pytest docker compose stack for Jenkins pipeline, testing against Kafka instances in already established environments.}

Developed library of common field test helpers for rapid testing. Reduced test spec writing times to minimal quick efforts. Implemented API call interceptions and mock response data in e2e suite to fully isolate UI testing from backend changes. Implemented test sandbox with complete suite of interception/mock data to replicate fully integrated frontend environment.}
\item {Contributed to Angular frontend project to unblock test automation efforts. Implemented placeholder services with 100\% unit test coverage for e2e API call interception. Implemented frontend bug fixes for functional and design issues.}
\item {Contributed to backend Cypress e2e automation framework. Updated and implemented new support functions and e2e tests. Debugged and fixed api e2e issues in Bitbucket/AWS. Helped refactor API e2e project from heavily docker dependent to dockerless implementation.}
\item {Updated and deployed cloud formation templates, bitbucket configurations, docker/docker compose configurations, typescript/eslint/npm configurations in service of streamlining running and deploying e2e (both UI and API) into our delivery pipelines.}
\item {Rapid investigation and fixing of both UI and API e2e issues in our delivery pipelines.}
\item {Took opportunity to contribute to API project with code duplication reduction, swagger updates, and service contract writing.}
\item {Paired and worked with every single developer (frontend, backend, fellow SDET) on the IM team to swarm on frontend, backend, e2e tasks.}
\item {Wrote BDD based test cases for UI and API stories. Reviewed story requirements, data contracts, acceptance criteria and chased down missing information and requirements to fill in gaps in client expectations and designs. Wrote bugs and ran bug triage sessions.}
